# Introduction

Cable Detector is a simple app to detect metal object and wires. It uses magnetic field sensor and it's magnitude value to detect object.

### Features

<p>Application has built-in functions to calibrate sensor for better detection like sensitivity and reading enviroment base magnitude field value as a base value.</p>

<p>Application also indicates to the user where possible wire can be.</p>

### Main app window (Arrow indicates possible direcrtion) :

<img height="500px" src="s1.jpg" />

### Wire detected:

<img height="500px" src="s4.jpg" />

### Calibration window and about application:
<p>
<img height="500px" src="s2.jpg" />
<img height="500px" src="s3.jpg" />
</p>

### Menu and fragments:

Application uses user friendly bottom  menu that will allow you to switch between metal detector, information about application and calibration. Detector uses reusable fragments with individual styles. Fragments can be used for future improvements in application.
