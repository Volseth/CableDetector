# Introduction

Cable Detector is a simple app to detect metal object and wires. It uses magnetic field sensor and it's magnitude value to detect object.

### Features

Application has built-in functions to calibrate sensor for better detection like sensitivity and reading enviroment base magnitude field value as a base value. 
Application also indicates to the user where possible wire can be.
